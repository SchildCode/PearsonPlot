# PearsonPlot
A tool to investigate statistical distribution of univariate observations. Plots skewness and kurtosis (together with bootsrapped observations) on a Pearson diagram, and compares to common statsitical distributions.

This workbook contains one Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro do analyze the statistical distribution of observations.

The workbook is a further development of Karl Pearson's diagram (www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_distribution) which was made popular again by the simplifed Cullen & Frey plot in R. This workbook vastly improves upon the Cullen and Frey plot by comparing the observations with many common distibutions. Moreover the 3 variants of the plot can be generated, depending on the range of skewness and kurtosis.

Paste your observations in Sheet "InputData".

The data is analyzed automatically when you click on the tab to view one of the skewness-vs-kurtosis plots (Chart1, Chart2 or Chart3).
