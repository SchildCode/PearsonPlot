# PearsonPlot
A tool to investigate statistical distribution of univariate observations. It plots the skewness-vs-kurtosis of your data (together with bootsrapped observations) on a Pearson diagram for comparison with common statsitical distributions.

This workbook contains a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro to analyze the statistical distribution of observations.

The workbook is a further development of Karl Pearson's diagram (www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_distribution) which was made popular again by the simplifed Cullen & Frey plot in R. This workbook vastly improves upon the Cullen and Frey plot by comparing the observations with many common distibutions. Moreover, 3 variants of the plot can be generated, depending on the range of skewness and kurtosis in your data.

## User-instructions
STEP1: Paste your observations into column A of sheet "InputData". There is no limit to the number of values.
STEP2: The data is analyzed automatically and plotted when you click on the tab for one of the plots (Chart1, Chart2 or Chart3).

## Output options
<p align="center"><img src="images/Chart1.png" alt="Chart 1"/><br/>
<b>Chart 1</b>: Distributions with positive skew in the range 0 to +2 (plotted squared), and excess kurtosis up to +6.</p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Chart2.png" alt="Chart 2"/><br/>
<b>Chart 2</b>: Distributions with skewness in the range +3 to +3, and excess kurtosis up to +8.</p>
<br/>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Chart3.png" alt="Chart 3"/><br/>
<b>Chart 3</b>: Distributions with any value of skewness and kurtosis. Both parameters are squashed into the range -1 to +1. Skewness squared is subtracted from kurtosis before squashing, thus reducing the "impossible region" to a small rectangle, and making  distributions with kurtosis &Proportional; skewnessÂ² into horizontal lines.</p>
